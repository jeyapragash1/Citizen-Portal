# Optional ML/vector search dependencies
# Install these only if you intend to build embeddings/FAISS locally.

sentence-transformers==2.2.2
huggingface-hub==0.11.0
# Transformers and tokenizers are pulled in; on Windows prefer conda-forge to avoid building Rust.
# If you use pip on Windows you may need to install a Rust toolchain or choose wheels.
# For FAISS (CPU) prefer installing via conda-forge: `conda install -c conda-forge faiss-cpu`

# If you want FAISS on CPU via pip (may not have prebuilt wheels for Windows):
# faiss-cpu==1.12.0

# Optional heavy ML runtime (PyTorch). If you have a GPU pick the appropriate wheel from PyTorch website.
# On Windows, installing via conda is generally easier:
# conda install -c pytorch pytorch torchvision cpuonly -y

# Note: tokenizers may require Rust to build from source. To avoid building from source on Windows,
# either use a conda environment with prebuilt wheels or install the Rust toolchain (rustup).
